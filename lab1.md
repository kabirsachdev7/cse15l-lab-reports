# Lab Report 1:An Introduction to GitHub Pages
## Step 1: Setting up CSE 15L Account
To setup my account, I began by first using the account lookup using the [Account Look Up Tool](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php), to decipher the username of my CSE 15L account.

Subsequently, I clicked on the global password account reset button and changed my password for only this course-specific account. Once successfully changing the password for my account, I had to wait approximately 15 minutes for the changes to be registered into the system. 

## Step 2: Installing Visual Studio Code
Once the changes were made, I opened up a new window and terminal in Visual Studio Code. I had the application already downloaded, and thus did not need to take further measures to acquire the application. However, if you do not have it downloaded, go to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it onto your computer.

## Step 3: Connecting to Terminal using SSH 
The account lookup allowed me to find out my username so I then wrote this line of code into the terminal: **$ ssh cs15lwi23aqo@ieng6.ucsd.edu** and put in my password. You would simply need to change the username to your own account name and then keep the address as **@ieng6.ucsd.edu**. For reference: *ACCOUNTNAME*@ieng6.ucsd.edu.

When successfully logged in, I was prompted with a message indicating that the terminal is now connected with a computer in the CSE Basement.

## Step 4: Running Commands into the Terminal
I proceeded to list out some commands into the terminal to examine different error messages, and what information is being outputted. You can try different linux commands such as these:

Lastly, I proceeded to [Github](github.com), and since I had an account already registered I did not need to make another one. However, if you do not have an account, simply register on their website.

Lastly, I proceeded to [Github](github.com), and since I had an account already registered I did not need to make another one. However, if you do not have an account, simply register on their website. 

On the Github site, I created a new Repository titled *cse15l-lab-reports* and left the settings on the repository as default. With my new repository, I created a new file called **index.md** which is a markdown file and then committed it into the repository. I also modified the *Pages* settings to make the branch source as **main**.

On the top of the **Pages**, you can also see that it is able to Visit the site of the new created repository as well. The message *“your site is live at”* allows us to click on the link and view the page in its entirety.
