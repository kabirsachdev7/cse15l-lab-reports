## Researching Commands: Grep
I chose to focus on the `grep` command because it is a powerful tool for searching text patterns in files and directories. As someone who works with code and system configurations, I find myself needing to search for specific lines of code or configuration options within files and directories quite often.

---

### 1. Command-line Option: `-w`
`-w` helps to match whole words in the file instead of matching substrings and thus can be particularly useful when searching to match whole words rather than its partial matches.

**Example 1: Searching for the word "name" in a the "HandRHawaii.txt" file located in the berlitz1 folder**
```
grep -w "name" written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HandRHawaii.txt 
        Heaven,” the meaning of its Hawaiian name. With plenty of beachfront, a
```
It can be seen that the command will search for the word and return only the lines that contain the whole word "name".

**Example 2: Searching for the word "century" in the "Athens-Intro.txt" file located in the berlitz2 folder**
```
grep -w "century" written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Athens-Intro.txt

M ention the name Athens and almost everyone will have some preconceived ideas about the city. Socrates painted a picture with words in the fourth century b.c., Pausanais during the Roman era. In the 20th century, Hollywood added its own slant to the legends, and every school child learns about the gods of the ancient Greek world — of Zeus, Athena, and Apollo.
However, the city of Athens is more than a sum of these ancient parts. Though it disappeared from the record books following the decline of the Roman Empire in the fifth century — its lineage and magnificent monuments unappreciated — it has risen like a phoenix from the ashes since 1834, the year that it became capital of the modern country of Greece. 
```
The example shown above is only a partial output of the text generated by the command. These paragrpahs encompass the lines with "century." 


I located this option from a source called, https://www.guru99.com/linux-grep.html, while researching more about these different commands that Grep encompasses of.

### 2. Command-line Option: `n`
The -n option in grep is used to print the line number along with the matched pattern and is useful when you want to know the exact line number where a pattern occurs in a file.

**Example 1: Searching for the line number for the word "century" in the file "HandRHawaii.txt"**
```
grep -n "century" written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HandRHawaii.txt 
44:        and refurbished for the new century, the venerable Kahala artfully
```

The example above shows that the word "century" in HandRHawaii is found on line 44 of the file.

**Example 2: Searching for the line number for the word "history" in the file "Algarve-History.txt"**
```
grep -n "history"  written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Algarve-History.txt 
22:To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history.
```
The example above shows that the word "history" in Algarve-History.txt is found on line 22 of the file.

### 3. Command-line Option: `--color=auto`

**Example 1: Searches for the pattern "century" in the file Algarve-History.txt and highlights the matches in color.**

```
grep --color=auto "century"  written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Algarve-History.txt 

```
<img width="972" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114371214/218623828-ecdb3806-e10b-412f-8b03-392f7f079ae3.png">


**Example 2: Searches for the pattern "a" in the file Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt and highlights the matches in color..**
```
grep --color=auto "a"  written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt

```
<img width="970" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114371214/218623771-1ebb9a6b-d38f-4be1-a959-41f153ce86a0.png">

The letter "a" in each matching line is highlighted in color, which makes it easier to see where the matches occur in the line. Note that the --color=auto option tells grep to use color highlighting only when the output is sent to a terminal, and not when the output is redirected to a file or a pipeline.

### 4. Command-line Option: `-v`
This command line is useful when searching for all lines that do not match a certain pattern or exclude certain lines from a search.

**Example 1: Search for all the lines in a file named "HandRHawaii.txt" located in the current directory that do not contain the word "century".**
```
grep -v "century" written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HandRHawaii.txt 

        Oahu (Including Honolulu)
        Aston Waikiki Sunset $$$ 229 Paoakalani Avenue, Honolulu, HI
        96815; Tel. (808) 922-2700 or (800) 336-5599; fax (808) 922-8785;
        <www.aston-hotels.com>. One of Aston’s many condominium resort
        properties, this modern high-rise has large rooms with complete
        kitchens. Lanais afford views of the Diamond Head end of Waikiki Beach.
        410 rooms.
```
The example above shows the use of -v which returns all the lines in the file that do **not** contain the word "art." To note, the output shown above is a minimal snippet of the overall code. 

Example 2: Search for all files in the current directory that do not contain the pattern "century".
```
grep -v "century" written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Athens-Intro.txt 


Athens and
The Athenians
The most important city in the world during its heyday in the fifth and fourth centuries b.c., the people of Athens were highly sophisticated in their thoughts and actions, their tastes and fashions. This small city set on and around a dramatic hill of rock — the Acropolis — became the cradle of western civilization. From the public meetings held here the concepts of citizenship, democracy, and debate developed. 
...
However, since joining the European Union (then the Common Market) in 1981, Greece has definitely moved closer to her western cousins, being one of the first wave of countries to join the Euro currency zone. The government in Athens has done well out of her union, receiving billions of dollars in aid, which has been used to upgrade vital road links throughout the country. Though the economy is still troubled, you are just as likely to see mobile phones as worry beads in a man’s hand, and the young wear the latest European fashions just as the Italians and French do. 
```

The command grep -v "century" written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Athens-Intro.txt searches for all lines in the file Athens-Intro.txt located in the written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2 directory that do not contain the word "century", and displays those lines in the terminal.
