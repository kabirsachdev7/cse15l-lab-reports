## Researching Commands: Grep
I chose to focus on the `grep` command because it is a powerful tool for searching text patterns in files and directories. As someone who works with code and system configurations, I find myself needing to search for specific lines of code or configuration options within files and directories quite often.

### 1. Command-line Option: `-w`
`-w` helps to match whole words in the file instead of matching substrings and thus can be particularly useful when searching for a particular word rather than a substring. 

Example: Searching for 
```
grep "file" ./written_2/sample.txt
```

### 2. Command-line Option: `-A`



### 3. Command-line Option: `-m`
